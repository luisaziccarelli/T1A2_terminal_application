- 14/11/2019: **Status update 1 - Design and plan**

I encountered a few roadbloacks during the design and planning process, particularly on choosing how the user was going to interact with the main 3 features of my program: main ingredients, ditary restrictions and recipes. Initially I wanted the user to input the ingredients they had at hand. Then I also wanted to make sure the recipes would match the user's dietary restrictions and also the ingredients they had available. I realized havin three major features and making them work together was going to be quite difficult for my skill level. The way I addressed this was by approaching my educator, who helped me simplify my program to get started. I decided to focus on only one major feature, and simplify the other two. What I learned from this phase and the roadblocks I encountered was the importance of approaching a problem one step at a time and starting small without getting caught up in the big picture. 


- 18/11/2019: **Status Update 3 - Coding**

When I started coding the first roadblock I found was when I was creating the conditionals for my dietary restrictions variable. I used logical operators to compare 2 conditions at a time, this gave me various error. This was a good opportunity to review my understanding of these concepts. Also in doing this and creating my first loop I realize I needed to review the syntax for the if/else statments. Once I figure this out creating the other methods in the program was a little bit more easy. Another roadblock I found was when printing out the recipes to the screen. I would have liked to use APIs or another tool to make my code more DRY, however I found that the easiest way at my skill level was including the recipes in the code itself.
