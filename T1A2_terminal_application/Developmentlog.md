- 14/11/2019. Status update 1: Design and plan

I encountered a few roadblocks at this point. The first roadblock was how to make sure that the items the user had available were actually recognized by the program. If we think about it the list of items of food someone can have is endless. I thought of creating a very long array of strings containing the most popular food items available in most peopleâ€™s kitchens. This leads to my second roadblock, the number of recipes the program had. If the list of ingredients was big, so would the list of recipes. This became even more complicated when throwing into the mix the dietary restriction variable. The way I addressed these roadblocks was by approaching my educator, who helped me simplify my program to get started. I removed the food variable and focused on the dietary restrictions first and then the recipes. This process for me was a good reminder of the importance of approaching the problem one step at a time and starting small without getting caught up in the big picture. 


- 16/11/2019. Coding: When I started coding the first roadblock I found was when I was creating the conditionals for my dietary restrictions variable. I used logical operators as I was comparing 2 conditions at a time, this part of the code was opportunity to review how these concepts. Also in doing this and creating my first loop I realize I needed to review the syntax for the if/else statments.
