- Status update #1

When I first started designing this project I realized that my idea was ambitious for my skill level and encountered a few roadblocks at this point. The first roadblock was how to make sure that the items the user had available were actually recognized by the program. If we think about it the list of items of food someone can have is endless. I thought of creating a very long array of strings containing the most popular food items available in most peopleâ€™s kitchens. This leads to my second roadblock, the number of recipes. If the list of ingredients is so big I would also need a very long list of recipes, diverse enough to contain the ingredients and combination of ingredients the user could have. This becomes even more complicated if you through in the mix the dietary restriction variable.  The way I addressed these roadblocks was by approaching my educator, who helped me simplify my program to get started. This process for me was a good reminder of the importance of approaching the problem one step at a time and starting small without getting caught up in the big picture.
