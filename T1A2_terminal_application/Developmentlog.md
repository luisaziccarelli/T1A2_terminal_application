- 14/11/2019. Status update 1: Design and plan

The first roadblock I encountered during the design and planning process was about how the user would interact with the main 3 features of my program: ingredients available, ditary restrictions and recipes. I was unsure how to handle the ingredients the user had available variable. If we think about it the list of items of food someone can have is endless. The second roadblock was the number of recipes the program had. Then I also wanted to make sure the recipes would match the user's dietary restrictions and also the items they had available. The way I addressed these roadblocks was by approaching my educator, who helped me simplify my program to get started. I decided to provide the user with options for the the ingredients available variable and decided to focus on the dietary restrictions first and then the recipes. This process for me was a good reminder of the importance of approaching a problem one step at a time and starting small without getting caught up in the big picture. 



- 18/11/2019. Status Update 3: Coding

When I started coding the first roadblock I found was when I was creating the conditionals for my dietary restrictions variable. I used logical operators to compare 2 conditions at a time, this gave me an error. This was a good opportunity to review my understanding of these concepts. Also in doing this and creating my first loop I realize I needed to review the syntax for the if/else statments. Once I figure this out creating the other methods in the program was a little bit more easy. Another roadblock I found was when it came to outputting recipes, I realized matching both the ingredients and the recipes would be a little too complicated, so I decided to concentrate in one variable only (dietary restrictions). In terms of displaying the recipes I would have liked to use APIs or another tool to make my code DRY, however I found the easiest way at my skill level I had to do this was to have the recipes in the code itself.
