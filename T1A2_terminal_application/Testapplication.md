# **Test Application** 

My recipe app was tested to ensure all the main 3 features implemented are performed as per Software Development Plan. Manual testing was performed by myself and showed to my educator during the implementation process who assisted with making the necessary corrections and error handling methods. 


| Test case        |  Test description                      | User input  |  Result | 
|---               |---                                     |---          |---      |
| Main ingredients | The program displays the list          | 1           | Passed  |
|                  | of ingredients, the user should be     | 2           | Passed  |
|                  | able to choose 1,2,3. If the user      | 3           | Passed  |
|                  | chooses an invalid option the program  |             |         | 
|                  | will output invalid and prompt them to |             |         |
|                  | until they until they select a correct |             |         |
|                  | option.                                |             |         |
| Dietary          | The program gets input (y/n) for each  | y, n        | Passed  |
| restrictions     | dietary restriction (vengan and/or gf) | y, y        | Passed  |
|                  | individually. The program then outputs | n, y        | Passed  |
|                  | a summary of their diet restrictions,  | n, n        | Passed  |
|                  | allowing combinations.                 |             |         |
|                  |                                        |             |         |
